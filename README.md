# roblox-ts template

This is my personal template for use in the roblox-ts ecosystem, utilizing
popular libraries and tools such as Flamework, React, and Reflex. For a
comprehensive list of packages, refer to the `package.json` file.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a streamlined approach for
initiating new projects, complete with frequently used patterns that I adopt
already configured. Additionally, it integrated my own customized eslint-config,
which is a highly opinionated guide for writing clean and consistent code.

### Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

My eslint-config is very strict and highly opinionated and may not be suitable
for beginners or people who prefer a more relaxed coding style. If you would
like to use this template without my eslint-config, you can remove it from
the `package.json` file, remove the `eslint.config.ts` file, along with the
`tsconfig.build.json` file, and then replace it with your own configuration.

### How to use:

1. Press the green `Use this template` button on the top right of the page to
   create a new repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install all of the dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm run watch-dev` to start the development server.
5. Sync in with rojo (either by using the rojo extension or by running `pnpm run
sync-dev`).
6. Start coding! üéâ

## Guide

The following is a guide to the tools of the project and how to typically use
them.

### Syncing with Rojo

While in development, I would typically use the `pnpm run watch-dev` command to
start the development server, and then use the `pnpm run sync-dev` command to
sync the project with Rojo.

To publish the project, I would use the `pnpm run build-prod` command to build
the game project with the production configuration. This will delete your
current `out` folder, replace it with the new build, and then automatically runs
darklua on the project (outputting the game project to the `dist` folder). This
allows us to completely remove any development only code, such that it does not
even exist in the final game project.

### Tip

All of the commands can be found in the `package.json` file under the `scripts`.
These can be accessed in VSCode through the `npm scripts` tab in the sidebar,
where you can run them by clicking the play button next to the command.

### Contributing

As this is a personal template, I am not typically seeking contributions.
However, if you discover any bugs, feel free to create a pull request or an
issue, and I will address it. If you wish to suggest a feature or improvement,
please submit an issue first to initiate discussion!
